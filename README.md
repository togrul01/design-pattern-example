# Design Patterns in Java

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in Java** repository! ðŸŽ¨ This repository is a practical guide to some of the most commonly used design patterns in software development, implemented in Java. Each pattern is explained with an overview and a practical example.

## Why Design Patterns?
Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common software design problems. They:
- Enhance code reusability and maintainability
- Encourage best practices in software development
- Simplify communication among developers by using a shared vocabulary

## Patterns Included
1. **Factory Pattern**
   - Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.

2. **Bridge Pattern**
   - Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.

3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**
   - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4. **Prototype Pattern**
   - Creates new objects by copying an existing object, promoting object reuse.

5. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

6. **Proxy Pattern**
   - Controls access to an object by providing a surrogate or placeholder.

Explore these patterns to enhance your understanding of software design and improve your ability to write robust, maintainable code.
